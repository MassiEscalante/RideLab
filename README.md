# 🏁 RideLab 🏁

Welcome to **RideLab**! This Vehicle Builder App is an interactive command-line application that allows users to create and manage their very own collection of vehicles! Whether you want to build a car, motorbike, or truck, this app provides a fun and dynamic way to interact with your vehicles through a variety of actions. 

## 🛑 Description

The **Vehicle Builder app** lets users engage with multiple vehicle types. When you start the app, you can either create a new vehicle or select one from an existing list. After picking a vehicle, the app gives you a range of actions, like:

- **Drive** your vehicle around
- **Tow** other vehicles (if you’re using a truck)
- Perform **vehicle-specific actions**

The app offers a seamless, looped experience where users can continue interacting with their vehicles until they choose to exit. Perfect for anyone who wants a hands-on approach to vehicle management in a fun and simple way! 🛠️

## 💡 Motivation

As a bootcamp student, I wanted to create an application that allows users to experience a playful simulation of driving and managing vehicles.

## 🚧 Why I Built This Project

I wanted to build this project to enhance my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and improve my skills in creating command-line applications and this seemed like a fun and engaging way to apply these concepts.

## ⚠️ Problem It Solves

**RideLab** solves the problem of static or one-time-use command-line applications by providing a dynamic, looped experience. Instead of creating something that only runs once, I wanted users to be able to repeatedly interact with their vehicles, making decisions, performing actions, and even switching between vehicles.

## 🚸 What I Learned

- Enhanced my ability to create **interactive command-line applications** using Inquirer.js.
- Improved knowledge of TypeScript and how it adds type safety and clarity to larger applications.

## ⛽ What Makes This Project Stand Out

- The app provides an ongoing experience for users by allowing them to interact with multiple vehicles, each with its own unique abilities.
- **Flexible vehicle management**: users can switch between different vehicle types, perform specific actions, and get back to the main menu seamlessly.
- Focus on a **clean, professional user interface** using the command line with colorful prompts and easy navigation.
